## 1. Executive status

### Program state

**ARO R1 is shipped; Q0 public reliability gates pass; P1 remains pre-implementation at a failed safe-environment baseline gate.**

The master vision, product boundaries, architecture, migration strategy, trust/safety, money, growth, design, Shipathon scope and P1–P6 sequence have been recovered and preserved in GitHub. `ARO_MASTER_DELIVERY_PLAN.md` is the canonical durable objective and cloud-task handoff through the verified P5 V1 loop.

The latest Living Opportunity OS experience direction and Seasons/AR strategy are also preserved as **strategic/spec-gated layers**, not as completed runtime features.

The existing Tonguee product provides a significant working vertical foundation. ARO does **not** restart from zero. The ARO runtime now lives in `leonartist7/ARO.club`; the original Tonguee repository and production providers remain preserved.

### Current gate

**ARO-R1 — Platform Rebrand and Repository Separation** is SHIPPED. PR #22 merged into `main` as `494817f`, and its Vercel production deployment reached `READY`. Public routes render while account actions fail closed with truthful copy when no backend is configured.

### Current enabling package

**ARO-Q0 — Reliability and CI Foundation** is **IMPLEMENTED / AUTH-GATE BLOCKED**. Lint, 61 unit tests, build and 16 public/fail-closed browser checks pass locally; GitHub Quality jobs are defined. Real Auth/RLS verification waits for I0 and branch protection remains founder-authorized provider work.

### Next runtime package

I0.1 update: the disposable Supabase CI subpackage is **IMPLEMENTED / REVIEW PENDING**, PR #27 (`specs/ARO-I0.1-EPHEMERAL-SUPABASE-CI.md`, `artifacts/ARO-I0.1/VERIFICATION.md`). Real CI platform/Auth/RLS-probe/reset/cleanup and Quality checks pass; security/operations review remains pending. No product schema or hosted environment is established by this fixture. Q0 authenticated app regression and P1 remain gated.

**ARO-P1 — Capability and Goal Foundation**

P1 is **SPEC-READY** and is not yet IN-PROGRESS. Its executable baseline is recorded under `artifacts/ARO-P1-BASELINE/VERIFICATION.md`, but the gate did not pass: a $0/month isolated project was rejected at the two-active-free-project limit. Tonguee production remains evidence-only and `aro-platform` remains quarantined.

## 2. Status legend

- **VERIFIED** — package acceptance/evidence completed for its intended scope.
- **IMPLEMENTED** — working implementation exists, but may need targeted ARO regression verification.
- **IN-PROGRESS** — active branch/PR exists.
- **BLOCKED** — named unresolved gate prevents progression.
- **SPEC-REQUIRED** — direction exists but implementation specification is not yet approved.
- **EXPLORATORY** — future idea only.
- **VISION** — long-term direction only.
- **DEPRECATED** — retained for historical/compatibility context.

## 4. Existing Tonguee implementation foundation

The following implementation predates the new ARO package sequence and is intentionally reused. Classify it as **IMPLEMENTED foundation** until its dependent ARO package performs targeted regression verification.

### Product and platform

- **React/Vite/Tailwind application:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Routing and reusable UI primitives:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Supabase Auth/Postgres/Storage patterns:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Persisted player/product state patterns:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Responsive/mobile experience:** IMPLEMENTED baseline.

### Trust and administration

- **Teacher application and verification workflow:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Private teacher documents/storage foundation:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Verified-only publishing protection:** IMPLEMENTED and architecturally mandatory.
- **Admin role/protected routes:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Admin application review tooling:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Admin users/teachers/experiences/bookings/reviews tooling:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Audit-log foundation:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Admin analytics/revenue tooling:** IMPLEMENTED foundation.

### Marketplace and experience loop

- **Teacher/host profiles:** IMPLEMENTED in language vertical.
- **Experiences catalogue/detail:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Booking flow:** IMPLEMENTED foundation.
- **Reviews:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Favourite/chat/supporting marketplace journeys:** IMPLEMENTED foundation.

### Identity, progress and gamification

- **Passport:** IMPLEMENTED language-vertical foundation.
- **Points/streak/badges/player state:** IMPLEMENTED legacy foundation.
- **Shop/loadout/gamification loop:** IMPLEMENTED legacy foundation.
- **Review/couple/badge reachability fixes:** IMPLEMENTED.

Important: legacy gamification does **not** equal ARO Seasons implementation. Any future ARO progression system must follow the ethical engagement and real-world verification direction in `ARO_EXPERIENCE_SYSTEM.md` / `ARO_SEASONS_AR.md` and an approved package spec.

### Quality baseline

- **Dark mode:** IMPLEMENTED with regression checks.
- **i18n:** IMPLEMENTED foundation.
- **Vitest:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Playwright E2E:** IMPLEMENTED.
- **Mobile overflow/regression testing patterns:** IMPLEMENTED.

### Important qualification

These statements mean the assets exist in the repository and were part of prior verified development. They do **not** certify every legacy flow for production under future ARO requirements. Every ARO package must re-test the foundations it depends on and record evidence.

## 6. Required verification before P1 implementation

Before P1 code begins:

1. **Satisfied:** SEC0 provider/history risk is classified, accepted, documented and remediated in the active tree.
2. Confirm P1 package spec exists and is marked SPEC-READY.
3. Audit current auth/profile/public-profile/RLS behavior that P1 will touch.
4. Define the exact private data model, retention/deletion behavior and provenance for goal/capability records.
5. Produce the owner/other-user/admin RLS matrix.
6. Establish current mobile/desktop/light/dark baseline screenshots for affected journeys.
7. Run relevant existing unit/E2E suites and record baseline failures separately from package regressions.
8. Set measurable performance/accessibility budgets for the affected surfaces.
9. Decide which portions of `ARO_EXPERIENCE_SYSTEM.md` are explicitly adopted by the P1 package; do not implement unrelated future visual mechanics by implication.

Only then move P1 to **IN-PROGRESS**.

---

## 7. Package completion ledger format

Every completed package appends a record like this:

```text
Package: ARO-P1
Status: VERIFIED
Branch/PR: ...
Spec version: ...
Migrations: ...
Acceptance: 12/12 PASS
Unit: PASS
E2E: PASS
RLS matrix: PASS
A11y: PASS
Mobile/Desktop: PASS
Light/Dark: PASS
Performance: PASS against package budget
Security/Privacy reviewer: approved
Known follow-ups: ...
Released: no/yes + environment
```

Do not delete older records; status history is useful operational evidence.

---

## 8. Immediate next sequence

`M0 governance → I0 isolated capacity → Q0 reliability → P1 → N1 platform decision → X1 experience foundation → P2 → A1 AI foundation → P3 → P4 → P5 → V1 release audit`

Do not parallelize downstream packages in a way that invents schema or assumptions P1/P2 are supposed to establish.

Do not move Seasons/AR into runtime simply because the strategic direction is now documented. The fastest path is not maximum simultaneous coding. It is **maximum parallelism inside a stable specification boundary**.
